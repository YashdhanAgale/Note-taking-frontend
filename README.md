# note-taking

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **note-taking**, a simple, clean, and intuitive noteâ€‘taking app built with the MERN stack, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I built this because sometimes you just need to jot down ideas, toâ€‘dos, or random thoughtsâ€”and having a lightweight, beautiful app makes it that much more fun.
